# Osiris Resources Gatsby/React Website

Please review the `README.md` in the `development` branch for instructions on how to run the project.

**Note - Any changes to the `main` branch will appear live on the production website. So the `main` branch should only be used for deployment of the `build` static files and not have other branches merged into it or commits made to it directly.**

                        <p className="bold-text">Most of the personal information we process is provided to us directly by you for one of the following reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide you with work finding services;</li>
                            <li>Communicate with you;</li>
                            <li>Enable you to upload your CV and apply for jobs;</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p className="bold-text">Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the lawful bases we rely on for processing this information are: </p>
                        <p><span className="bold-text">Your consent.</span> You are able to remove your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting us.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <h2 className="mt-4 mb-3">How we store your personal information</h2>
                        <p>Your information is securely stored. We have implemented and maintained appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access. Only authorised personnel and third-party service providers are provided with access to personal data on a need-to-know basis, and these employees and service providers are contractually obliged to treat this information as confidential.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <h2 className="mt-4 mb-3">How long we hold your personal data for</h2>
                        <p>We will keep your personal data for as long as we need to in order to fulfil the purpose we collected it for, which may be an ongoing purpose. For example, if you’re a candidate, we will retain your personal data for the duration of our business relationship with you and beyond, as we often support candidates with job placements over many years and potentially throughout their careers.</p>
                        <p>We keep some personal data for longer than others. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider factors such as the purposes for which we process your personal data, including any legal, regulatory, accounting and reporting obligations, the nature and amount of personal data that we hold about you, and the potential risk of harm to you from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data.</p>
                        <p>Where we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes, we will do so until you ask us to stop, and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your request). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data indefinitely, so that we can respect your request.</p>
                        <br/>
